## Reflection on Assignmentsüìù
### 1. Assignment 1‚úçÔ∏è
Through this talk, I gained a lot of information about ICT jobs such as the job scope for each career in ICT, technology used in the ICT field and skills needed as a good IT contributor. After getting some advice from the speakers, I have done a self-reflection about our career in the future. Firstly, I should choose our career wisely after we graduate in the future. There are a lot of ICT jobs such as software developer, Android developer, UI/UX designer and web developer. I need to think wisely before making any decision.I also learn to engage more when working in groups to increase the efficiency of tasks. I should also create our own portfolio and arrange our assignments nicely on platforms like Github or LinkedIn to prove that we are able to handle the jobs in the ICT field. As an IT professional and ICT developer, I should keep continuous learning as the technology is constantly evolving.We are encouraged to attend free online classes and workshops about ICT so that we can adapt to this rapidly changing technological landscape .

### 2. Assignment 2‚úçÔ∏è

Students as the users of the various platforms of UTM such as UTMSmart, elearning and MyUtm Portal, we can get to know how these platforms operate on the backend through the visit to UTM Digital. We also get to know the individuals responsible for operating these platforms behind the scenes.


From this visit, the biggest impact of these activities is the real-world application. It helps us to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical applications. These activities can also enhance our understanding of the field of study, industry practices, and potential career paths. This kind of industrial visit also fosters our enthusiasm for the TIS course.  


Through this industrial visit, it motivates us to engage in activities that can develop some practical skills, so we can enhance our overall competency in our study. We also learn to acquire more skills and programming languages during our  study journey to have a better chance to get an ideal job.


Surely the activities can spark our excitement and interest because we could witness the real world applications of what we are studying now. The industrial visit to UTM Digital has ignited our passion for the computer science course. The visit had positively influenced our commitment to our studies and future career paths.


Visiting the organization and attending the talk helps us learn the course material better. This is because we are exposed to the real world scenarios directly. This can reinforce the theoretical concepts we learned and improve our understanding about what we had learned. The practical exposure, professional interactions, and real-world applications will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of our course material.

### 3. Assignment 3‚úçÔ∏è

From this talk, it underscores the importance of continuous learning and adaptability innavigating the complexities of managing and optimizing data for meaningful andactionable insights.
Through this, I have been inspired to learn more about data analysisskill. So, now I have to enhance my programming skill in order to lay a solid foundation.I also get know of many specific technology used in database such as PostgreSQL,ClickHouse and so on to have deeper understanding about the field of data egineering.


### 4. Assignment 4‚úçÔ∏è

Dr. Seah Choon Sen's i-Farm presentation really caught my attention with its smart blend of urban farming andtechnology. The idea of bringing fresh veggies to people'sdoorsteps, especially in the face of pandemic-related shortages, is not just practical but also forward-thinking. Theuse of IoT and data analytics in the farming process ensureefficiency and freshness. I-Farm helps human life inconvenience and accessibility. I-Farm brings fresh vegetables directly to people's doorsteps, eliminating the need to travel to distant markets. This convenience is particularly beneficial for individuals with busy schedules, mobility challenges, or those living in areas with limited access to fresh produce.

### 5. PC Assemble (Lab)‚úçÔ∏è

During the PC Assemble Lab on 23 October 2023, I attained practical experience in assembling a PC. The knowledge gained included identifying and connecting various components such as the CPU fan, RAM, HDD, expansion card and power supply. Through this, I have new insight about the PC components. At the end, there is a small quiz to test the understanding of students about the way to install and the identities of components. For me, this activity brought knowledges with a fun way to make the learning become interesting and efficient.

### 6. TIS Design Thinking‚úçÔ∏è

In this design thinking, I have learnt the importance of teamwork. All members have given cooperation to complete this design thinking by combining the idea and finally creating a satisfactory prototype. This gives me a sense of achievement in our team work. Besides, I also learn how to proceed the stages in design thinking which is empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test. Therefore, I am able to cooperate with my partners well by applying these skills in the future to reach my goal. I plan to enhance my problem-solving skills to address challenges faced with a systematic mindset. Moreover, I will be open-minded to take on board any creative ideas so that I will not miss any opportunity to develop new technology and products. Besides, communication is a very significant part to improve potential in the industry. I will always practice to express my ideas concisely to boost the efficiency in communication. Through this, I believe that I am able to improve my potential in industry.
